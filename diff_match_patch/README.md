This is the google-diff-match-patch project, available from
https://code.google.com/archive/p/google-diff-match-patch/.

django-reversion requires it in order to produce views with diffs. It is not
required for other purposes, and can be excised if diff-production is not
desired and views are revised so as not to include diffs.
