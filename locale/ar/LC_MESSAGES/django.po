"users to freely access otherwise paywalled resources. This platform allows "

"that end, in order to be eligible for the Wikipedia Library program, we "
"require that you be registered for a user account on the projects. We "
"generally give preference to users with at least 500 edits and six (6) "
"months of activity, but these are not strict requirements. You must have the "
"Special:EmailUser feature enabled on at least one version of Wikipedia, and "
"you will identify that as your \"home\" wiki when you create an account. We "
