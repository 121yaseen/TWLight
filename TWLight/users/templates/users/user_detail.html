      Translators: this should show up for people who log in with a username/password and not OAuth, so we don't know what their Wikipedia identity is.

      Hi, {{ username }}! You don't have a Wikipedia editor profile attached
      to your account here, so you are probably a site administrator.

      If you aren't a site administrator, something weird has happened. You
      won't be able to apply for access to protected resources without a
      Wikipedia editor profile. Unless you know there's a good reason why your
      account doesn't have an editor attached (e.g. you are a site
      administrator), you should log out and create a new account by logging in
      via OAuth, or contact a site administrator for help.
